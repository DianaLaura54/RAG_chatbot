This was my diploma project. My chatbot StorySage answers questions from children's books, with a normal pipeline or an advanced pipeline where the user can pick the embedding model, the type of chunking, search, the large language model(llama3 or mistral), if the
user wants query optimization or the use of reranker. Has a "generate random question" option that generates a question from my QA pairs CSV file where I stored 500 QA from the books.
It also features a quiz selection and generator option from those books. It uses metrics such as BERTScore and ROUGE-L, has different kind of plots, extracts the images that belong to the chunks returned. It has text to speech option that makes the answer easier 
for children to understand.
